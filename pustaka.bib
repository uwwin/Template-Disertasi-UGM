abstract = {This manuscript presents a comprehensive approach to enhance the accuracy of skin lesion image classification based on the HAM10000 and BCN20000 datasets. Building on prior feature fusion models, this research introduces an optimized cluster-based fusion approach to address limitations observed in our previous methods. The study proposes two novel feature fusion strategies, KFS-MPA (using K-means) and DFS-MPA (using DBSCAN), for skin lesion classification. These approaches leverage optimized clustering-based deep feature fusion and the marine predator algorithm (MPA). Ten fused feature sets are evaluated using three classifiers on both datasets, and their performance is compared in terms of dimensionality reduction and accuracy improvement. The results consistently demonstrate that the DFS-MPA approach outperforms KFS-MPA and other compared fusion methods, achieving notable dimensionality reduction and the highest accuracy levels. ROC-AUC curves further support the superiority of DFS-MPA, highlighting its exceptional discriminative capabilities. Five-fold cross-validation tests and a comparison with the previously proposed feature fusion method (FOWFS-AJS) are performed, confirming the effectiveness of DFS-MPA in enhancing classification performance. The statistical validation based on the Friedman test and Bonferroni-Dunn test also supports DFS-MPA as a promising approach for skin lesion classification among the evaluated feature fusion methods. These findings emphasize the significance of optimized cluster-based deep feature fusion in skin lesion classification and establish DFS-MPA as the preferred choice for feature fusion in this study.},

@article{Sharen2024,
abstract = {Early detection is essential for the successful removal of all malignant lesions from the body, and skin cancer is one of the most widespread cancers globally. In medical image analysis, identifying the diseased area or the region of interest (ROI) significantly relies on advanced network models. Segmenting skin lesions is a strenuous task due to the presence of varied lesion shapes, ambiguous edge borders, low contrast, and presences of artifacts and noises. Performing manual identification of ROI on a large-scale skin lesion assessment is challenging. This study proposes enhanced FPN and U-Net network models for supervised skin lesion segmentation. The study investigates eight Convolutional Neural Network architectures, including U-Net (classic), U-Net + MobileNet, U-Net + InceptionV3, U-Net + DenseNet121, FPN(classic), FPN + MobileNet, FPN + InceptionV3, and FPN + DenseNet121. The performance of these architectures is evaluated using three optimizers (RMSProp, Adam, and SGD) on the ISIC 2016 dataset. The evaluation metrics include accuracy, IoU, and Dice coefficients on the testing dataset. The experimental findings demonstrate that the FPN architecture with DenseNet121 as the backbone encoder and the U-Net architecture with MobileNet as the backbone encoder achieved the highest dice coefficient of 0.93, accuracy of 0.96, and IoU of 0.87. Our proposed solution for enhancing skin lesion segmentation is called FDUM-Net, which is a combination of enhanced FPN with DenseNet as encoder and U-Net with MobileNet designed to capture high-level information and context for more accurate results. These outcomes surpass the performance of previous research and can assist dermatologists in diagnosing skin cancer more efficiently.},

abstract = {TensorFlow is a machine learning system that operates at large scale and in heterogeneous environments. Tensor-Flow uses dataflow graphs to represent computation, shared state, and the operations that mutate that state. It maps the nodes of a dataflow graph across many machines in a cluster, and within a machine across multiple computational devices, including multicore CPUs, generalpurpose GPUs, and custom-designed ASICs known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). This architecture gives flexibility to the application developer: whereas in previous "parameter server" designs the management of shared state is built into the system, TensorFlow enables developers to experiment with novel optimizations and training algorithms. TensorFlow supports a variety of applications, with a focus on training and inference on deep neural networks. Several Google services use TensorFlow in production, we have released it as an open-source project, and it has become widely used for machine learning research. In this paper, we describe the TensorFlow dataflow model and demonstrate the compelling performance that Tensor-Flow achieves for several real-world applications.},

abstract = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a stochastic population-based algorithm motivated by intelligent collective behavior of some animals. The most important advantages of the PSO are that PSO is easy to implement and there are few parameters to adjust. The inertia weight (w) is one of PSO's parameters originally proposed by Shi and Eberhart to bring about a balance between the exploration and exploitation characteristics of PSO. Since the introduction of this parameter, there have been a number of proposals of different strategies for determining the value of inertia weight during a course of run. This paper presents the first comprehensive review of the various inertia weight strategies reported in the related literature. These approaches are classified and discussed in three main groups: constant, time-varying and adaptive inertia weights. A new adaptive inertia weight approach is also proposed which uses the success rate of the swarm as its feedback parameter to ascertain the particles' situation in the search space. The empirical studies on fifteen static test problems, a dynamic function and a real world engineering problem show that the proposed particle swarm optimization model is quite effective in adapting the value of w in the dynamic and static environments. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

In this research, credit card fraud detection is performed using a fuzzy database. It has been considered a data mining challenge to reliably identify whether or not a transaction is legitimate. This paper discusses the LSTM method and fuzzy logic. The learning process was sped up and made more precise by using a technique called particle swarm optimization (PSO). Performance values have been compared with those of the LSTM and fuzzy logic techniques, and a PSO-based neural network has been intensively trained by increasing the number of iterations and the population, or number of swarms. It has been shown that the PSO-based algorithm yields the best result for detecting fraudulent transactions. The goal of this method is to lower the mean square error (MSE) rate of the system. PSO is a popular optimization technique that can be used to locate the optimal set of features for the credit card fraud detection system. The proposed method PSO shows less mean squared error compared with Fuzzy and LSTM techniques.},

This paper focuses on a new and primary sample for PSO, which is named phasor particle swarm optimization (PPSO) and is based on modeling the particle control parameters with a phase angle ($\theta$), inspired from phasor theory in the mathematics. This phase angle ($\theta$) converts PSO algorithm to a self-adaptive, trigonometric, balanced, and nonparametric metaheuristic algorithm. The performance of PPSO is tested on real-parameter optimization problems including unimodal and multimodal standard test functions and traditional benchmark functions. The optimization results show good and efficient performance of PPSO algorithm in real-parameter global optimization, especially for high-dimensional optimization problems compared with other improved PSO algorithms taken from the literature. The phasor model can be used to expand different types of PSO and other algorithms. The source codes of the PPSO algorithms are publicly available at https://github.com/ebrahimakbary/PPSO.},

For a given energy or cost function, by following chaotic ergodic orbits, a chaotic dynamic system may eventually reach the global optimum or its good approximation with high probability. To enhance the performance of particle swarm optimization (PSO), which is an evolutionary computation technique through individual improvement plus population cooperation and competition, hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed by incorporating chaos. Firstly, adaptive inertia weight factor (AIWF) is introduced in PSO to efficiently balance the exploration and exploitation abilities. Secondly, PSO with AIWF and chaos are hybridized to form a chaotic PSO (CPSO), which reasonably combines the population-based evolutionary searching ability of PSO and chaotic searching behavior. Simulation results and comparisons with the standard PSO and several meta-heuristics show that the CPSO can effectively enhance the searching efficiency and greatly improve the searching quality. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In recent years, the use of artificial intelligence to assist the medical industry in making more accurate diagnoses has become popular. To achieve a more accurate diagnosis, more data is often needed to constantly improve the model. However, when data needs to be shared by patients from different hospitals, patients may be reluctant to share their privacy with unknown institutions that they do not trust. This situation creates a Data Silo problem that hinders progress in AI diagnostics. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to use the Federated Learning framework to train models with private patient data on local clients and aggregate models on a central server, allowing participants to jointly train models without sharing data and technically breaking down Data Silos and enabling AI collaboration. Experiments demonstrate that compared to traditional CNN training, the CNN model base on the Federated Learning framework sacrifices 8% of accuracy to accomplish the above requirements. Due to the inherent nature of the distributed system, the training time and node communication time is also favorable. {\textcopyright} 2023 IEEE.},

abstract = {Human skin is a very sensitive part and is infected with various types of issues. Skin disease is one of them and 70% to 80% of the population is infected with one of the skin diseases. Expensive clinical screening and dermatological analysis are the only solutions to detect skin disease. Legacy classification methods are not appropriate to tackle the issues related to the color, texture, and privacy of the skin disease dataset. Both deep learning(DL) techniques and federated learning(FL)can be better solutions for classification and privacy issues related to skin datasets. The collaboration of both in the medical field can be a significant contribution. In this paper, federated learning-based deep learning was applied to a publicly available dataset consisting of 10 different skin diseases. Various deep learning models were applied, and privacy concerns were preserved with a federated learning approach. Here, the dataset was enhanced with several image augmentation strategies. In this research, several models were used and after observation, it was found that the InceptionNet outperformed and produced a better accuracy rate of 98.89%. In this research, complete experiments were set with varying client values and communication rounds. {\textcopyright} 2023 IEEE.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is progressively permeating medicine, notably in the realm of assisted diagnosis. However, the traditional unimodal AI models, reliant on large volumes of accurately labeled data and single data type usage, prove insufficient to assist dermatological diagnosis. Augmenting these models with text data from patient narratives, laboratory reports, and image data from skin lesions, dermoscopy, and pathologies could significantly enhance their diagnostic capacity. Large-scale pre-training multimodal models offer a promising solution, exploiting the burgeoning reservoir of clinical data and amalgamating various data types. This paper delves into unimodal models' methodologies, applications, and shortcomings while exploring how multimodal models can enhance accuracy and reliability. Furthermore, integrating cutting-edge technologies like federated learning and multi-party privacy computing with AI can substantially mitigate patient privacy concerns in dermatological datasets and further fosters a move towards high-precision self-diagnosis. Diagnostic systems underpinned by large-scale pre-training multimodal models can facilitate dermatology physicians in formulating effective diagnostic and treatment strategies and herald a transformative era in healthcare. {\textcopyright} 2023 The Authors},

In recent years, researchers focused on addressing skin cancer at the edge because of enhanced real-time processing capabilities, reduced data vulnerability, and cost-effective hard-ware solutions. Despite the advancements in neural networks and hardware for edge applications, there is still a gap in translating related theoretical findings into practical applications. To bridge this gap, we propose a Internet of Things framework that is lightweight and easily scalable through federated learning. Furthermore, our end-to-end framework could incorporate other CV models and enhance their inference capabilities through edge acceleration. Additionally, we also developed an end-to-end application for mobile devices to detect skin cancer and recommend nearby skin specialists or discussion forums.

abstract = {Federated learning enables the collaborative training of machine learning models across multiple organizations, eliminating the need for sharing sensitive data. Nevertheless, in practice, the data distributions among these organizations are often non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID), which poses significant challenges for traditional federated learning. To tackle this challenge, we present a hierarchical federated learning framework based on blockchain technology, which is designed to enhance the training of non-IID data., protect data privacy and security, and improve federated learning performance. The framework builds a global shared pool by constructing a blockchain system to reduce the non-IID degree of local data and improve model accuracy. In addition, we use smart contracts to distribute and collect models and design a main blockchain to store local models for federated aggregation, achieving decentralized federated learning. We train the MLP model on the MNIST dataset and the CNN model on the Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets to verify its feasibility and effectiveness. The experimental results show that the proposed strategy significantly improves the accuracy of decentralized federated learning on three tasks with non-IID data.},

abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has brought significant advantages to applications where collaborative learning should occur at multiple participating devices to enhance user experience in specific tasks. However, FL results in privacy leakage when n-1 clients collude to infer the model of another client. In this paper, we not only implement an FL framework but propose a methodology for preventing privacy leakage while realizing machine learning-based automatic hand-written digit recognition. Our framework supports the FL of deep networks where models trained locally are averaged. Two machine learning models Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) are implemented with FL. We proposed an algorithm, Federated Averaging with Privacy Leakage Prevention (FA-PLP), for model averaging to be done by the server. Our algorithm exploits differential privacy (DP) for realizing model averaging while getting rid of chances of privacy leakage. We evaluated our framework with two distributions of the MNIST dataset. Our empirical results revealed that FA-PLP with the CNN model could achieve the highest accuracy of 95.38%.},

abstract = {A disease is an abnormal condition that negatively impacts the functioning of the human body. Pathology determines the causes behind the disease and identifies its development mechanism and functional consequences. Each disease has different identification methods, including X-ray scans for pneumonia, covid-19, and lung cancer, whereas biopsy and CT-scan can identify the presence of skin cancer and Alzheimer's disease, respectively. Early disease detection leads to effective treatment and avoids abiding complications. Deep learning has provided a vast number of applications in medical sectors resulting in accurate and reliable early disease predictions. These models are utilized in the healthcare industry to provide supplementary assistance to doctors in identifying the presence of diseases. Majorly, these models are trained through secondary data sources since healthcare institutions refrain from sharing patients' private data to ensure confidentiality, which limits the effectiveness of deep learning models due to the requirement of extensive datasets for training to achieve optimal results. Federated learning deals with the data in such a way that it doesn't exploit the privacy of a patient's data. In this work, a wide variety of disease detection models trained through federated learning have been rigorously reviewed. This meta-analysis provides an in-depth review of the federated learning architectures, federated learning types, hyperparameters, dataset utilization details, aggregation techniques, performance measures, and augmentation methods applied in the existing models during the development phase. The review also highlights various open challenges associated with the disease detection models trained through federated learning for future research.},

Elevating the quality of healthcare services and delivering improved patient care necessitates a knowledge base rooted in data-driven insights. Deep learning models have proven to excel in this regard, as they are specifically designed to embrace a data-driven approach. These models thrive on exposure to larger datasets, which enables them to continuously improve their performance. However, as healthcare organizations strive to aggregate clinical records onto central servers to construct robust deep learning models, concerns surrounding privacy, data ownership, and legal restrictions have emerged. Safeguarding sensitive medical data while harnessing collective knowledge from multiple healthcare centers is a challenging balancing act. One promising approach to address these concerns is the use of privacy-preserving techniques that allow for the utilization of data from multiple centers without compromising security. Federated learning (FL) is a technique that has emerged to enable the deployment of large machine learning models trained across multiple data centers without the necessity of sharing sensitive information. In this article, we present the most recent findings derived from a systematic literature review focusing on the application of federated learning in healthcare settings. This review offers insights into the current state of research and practical implementations of FL within the healthcare domain. By leveraging federated learning, healthcare institutions can harness the collective power of their data while upholding privacy and data security standards, ultimately leading to more effective and data-driven healthcare solutions.},

abstract = {Federated learning is a powerful technique that enables collaborative learning among different clients. Prototype-based federated learning is a specific approach that improves the performance of local models by integrating class prototypes. However, prototype-based federated learning faces several challenges, such as prototype redundancy and prototype failure, which can limit its accuracy. In addition, it is also susceptible to poisoning attacks and server malfunction, which can degrade the quality of prototypes. To address these issues, we propose FedRFQ, a prototype-based federated learning approach that aims to reduce redundancy, minimize failure, and improve quality. FedRFQ leverages the SoftPool mechanism with prototype-based federated learning, which effectively mitigates prototype redundancy and prototype failure on Non-IID data. Moreover, we introduce the BFT-detect algorithm, a BFT detectable aggregation algorithm, to ensure the security of FedRFQ against poisoning attacks and server malfunction. Finally, we conducted experiments on three different datasets, namely MNIST, FEMNIST, and CIFAR-10. The results demonstrate that FedRFQ outperforms existing baselines in terms of accuracy when handling Non-IID data.},

abstract = {The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is growing rapidly. Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is one of the common healthcare applications that assist doctors to monitor patients with chronic or acute illness at remote locations, elderly people in-home care, and even hospitalized patients. The reliability of manual patient monitoring systems depends on staff time management which is dependent on their workload. Conventional patient monitoring involves invasive approaches which require skin contact to monitor health status. This study aims to do a comprehensive review of RPM systems including adopted advanced technologies, AI impact on RPM, challenges and trends in AI-enabled RPM. This review explores the benefits and challenges of patient-centric RPM architectures enabled with Internet of Things wearable devices and sensors using the cloud, fog, edge, and blockchain technologies. The role of AI in RPM ranges from physical activity classification to chronic disease monitoring and vital signs monitoring in emergency settings. This review results show that AI-enabled RPM architectures have transformed healthcare monitoring applications because of their ability to detect early deterioration in patients' health, personalize individual patient health parameter monitoring using federated learning, and learn human behavior patterns using techniques such as reinforcement learning.

abstract = {Since its introduction in 2016, researchers have applied the idea of Federated Learning (FL) to several domains ranging from edge computing to banking. The technique's inherent security benefits, privacy-preserving capabilities, ease of scalability, and ability to transcend data biases have motivated researchers to use this tool on healthcare datasets. While several reviews exist detailing FL and its applications, this review focuses solely on the different applications of FL to medical imaging datasets, grouping applications by diseases, modality, and/or part of the body. This Systematic Literature review was conducted by querying and consolidating results from ArXiv, IEEE Xplorer, and PubMed. Furthermore, we provide a detailed description of FL architecture, models, descriptions of the performance achieved by FL models, and how results compare with traditional Machine Learning (ML) models. Additionally, we discuss the security benefits, highlighting two primary forms of privacy-preserving techniques, including homomorphic encryption and differential privacy. Finally, we provide some background information and context regarding where the contributions lie. The background information is organized into the following categories: architecture/setup type, data-related topics, security, and learning types. While progress has been made within the field of FL and medical imaging, much room for improvement and understanding remains, with an emphasis on security and data issues remaining the primary concerns for researchers. Therefore, improvements are constantly pushing the field forward. Finally, we highlighted the challenges in deploying FL in medical imaging applications and provided recommendations for future directions. {\textcopyright} 2023 by the authors.},

abstract = {In recent years, the security of AI systems has drawn increasing research attention, especially in the medical imaging realm. To develop a secure medical image analysis (MIA) system, it is a must to study possible backdoor attacks (BAs), which can embed hidden malicious behaviors into the system. However, designing a unified BA method that can be applied to various MIA systems is challenging due to the diversity of imaging modalities (e.g., X-Ray, CT, and MRI) and analysis tasks (e.g., classification, detection, and segmentation). Most existing BA methods are designed to attack natural image classification models, which apply spatial triggers to training images and inevitably corrupt the semantics of poisoned pixels, leading to the failures of attacking dense prediction models. To address this issue, we propose a novel Frequency-Injection based Backdoor Attack method (FIBA) that is capable of delivering attacks in various MIA tasks. Specifically, FIBA leverages a trigger function in the frequency domain that can inject the low-frequency information of a trigger image into the poisoned image by linearly combining the spectral amplitude of both images. Since it preserves the semantics of the poisoned image pixels, FIBA can perform attacks on both classification and dense prediction models. Experiments on three benchmarks in MIA (i.e., ISIC-2019 [4] for skin lesion classification, KiTS-19 [17] for kidney tumor segmentation, and EAD-2019 [1] for endoscopic artifact detection), validate the effectiveness of FIBA and its superiority over stateof-the-art methods in attacking MIA models and bypassing backdoor defense. Source code will be available at code. {\textcopyright} 2022 IEEE.},

abstract = {The automatic analysis of medical data and images to help diagnosis has recently become a major area in the application of deep learning. In general, deep learning techniques can be effective when a large high-quality dataset is available for model training. Thus, there is a need for sample-efficient learning techniques, particularly in the field of medical image analysis, as significant cost and effort are required to obtain a sufficient number of well-annotated high-quality training samples. In this paper, we address the problem of deep neural network training under sample deficiency by investigating several sample-efficient deep learning techniques. We concentrate on applying these techniques to skin burn image analysis and classification. We first build a large-scale, professionally annotated dataset of skin burn images, which enables the establishment of convolutional neural network (CNN) models for burn severity assessment with high accuracy. We then deliberately set data limitation conditions and adapt several sample-efficient techniques, such as transferable learning (TL), self-supervised learning (SSL), federated learning (FL), and generative adversarial network (GAN)-based data augmentation, to those conditions. Through comprehensive experimentation, we evaluate the sample-efficient deep learning techniques for burn severity assessment, and show, in particular, that SSL models learned on a small task-specific dataset can achieve comparable accuracy to a baseline model learned on a six-times larger dataset. We also demonstrate the applicability of FL and GANs to model training under different data limitation conditions that commonly occur in the area of healthcare and medicine where deep learning models are adopted. {\textcopyright} 2022 by the authors.},

abstract = {Distributedly training models across diverse clients with heterogeneous data samples can significantly impact the convergence of federated learning. Various novel federated learning methods address these challenges but often require significant communication resources and local computational capacity, leading to reduced global inference accuracy in scenarios with imbalanced label data distribution and quantity skew. To tackle these challenges, we propose FedVGL, a Federated Variational Generative Learning method that directly trains a local generative model to learn the distribution of local features and improve global target model inference accuracy during aggregation, particularly under conditions of severe data heterogeneity. FedVGL facilitates distributed learning by sharing generators and latent vectors with the global server, aiding in global target model training from mapping local data distribution to the variational latent space for feature reconstruction. Additionally, FedVGL implements anonymization and encryption techniques to bolster privacy during generative model transmission and aggregation. In comparison to vanilla federated learning, FedVGL minimizes communication overhead, demonstrating superior accuracy even with minimal communication rounds. It effectively mitigates model drift in scenarios with heterogeneous data, delivering improved target model training outcomes. Empirical results establish FedVGL's superiority over baseline federated learning methods under severe label imbalance and data skew condition. In a Label-based Dirichlet Distribution setting with $\alpha$=0.01 and 10 clients using the MNIST dataset, FedVGL achieved an exceptional accuracy over 97% with the VGG-9 target model.},

abstract = {The rapid progress of artificial intelligence expands its wide applicability in Internet of Things (IoT). Meanwhile, data insufficient and data source privacy are key supply chain challenges facing IoT especially in the healthcare industry. To address this problem in healthcare IoT, in this article, we propose a skin cancer detection model based on federated learning integrated with deep generation model. First, we employ dual generative adversarial networks to address the problem of insufficient data. In addition, to improve the quality of generated images, we synchronously optimize the sharpness of images, Frechet inception distance, image diversity, and loss using knee point-driven evolutionary algorithm (KnEA). Then, we protect patient information privacy by training federated skin cancer framework. Finally, we employ the ISIC 2018 dataset to test the performance of the proposed training model under different situations, including using identically distributed data, nonidentically distributed data, a sparse convolutional neural network, and a fully connected convolutional neural network. The experiment results demonstrate that the accuracy and area under the curve reach 91% and 88%, respectively. This model can help resolve problems of insufficient data in smart medicine of IoT and protect the privacy of user data while also providing an excellent detection rate.  {\textcopyright} 2005-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Medical image segmentation is crucial in clinical diagnosis, helping physicians identify and analyze medical conditions. However, this task is often accompanied by challenges like sensitive data, privacy concerns, and expensive annotations. Current research focuses on personalized collaborative training of medical segmentation systems, ignoring that obtaining segmentation annotations is time-consuming and laborious. Achieving a perfect balance between annotation cost and segmentation performance while ensuring local model personalization has become a valuable direction. Therefore, this study introduces a novel Model-Heterogeneous Semi-Supervised Federated (HSSF) Learning framework. It proposes Regularity Condensation and Regularity Fusion to transfer autonomously selective knowledge to ensure the personalization between sites. In addition, to efficiently utilize unlabeled data and reduce the annotation burden, it proposes a Self-Assessment (SA) module and a Reliable Pseudo-Label Generation (RPG) module. The SA module generates self-assessment confidence in real-time based on model performance, and the RPG module generates reliable pseudo-label based on SA confidence. We evaluate our model separately on the Skin Lesion and Polyp Lesion datasets. The results show that our model performs better than other methods characterized by heterogeneity. Moreover, it exhibits highly commendable performance even in homogeneous designs, most notably in region-based metrics.

abstract = {Primary Sj{\"{o}}gren's syndrome (pSS) is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease with diverse clinical picture and outcome. The disease affects primarily middle-aged females and involves the exocrine glands leading to dry mouth and eyes. When the disease extends beyond the exocrine glands (systemic form), certain extraglandular manifestations involving liver, kidney, lungs, peripheral nervous system and the skin may occur. Primary SS is considered the crossroad between autoimmunity and lymphoproliferation, since approximately 5% of patients develop NHL associated lymphomas. As with every chronic disease with complex aetiopathogenesis and clinical heterogeneity, pSS has certain unmet needs that have to be addressed: a) classification and stratification of patients; b) understanding the distinct pathogenetic mechanisms and clinical phenotypes; c) defining and interpreting the real needs of patients regarding the contemporary diagnostic and therapeutic approaches; d) physician and patients' training regarding the wide spectrum of the disease; e) creating common policies across European countries to evaluate and manage SS patients. To achieve these goals, an intense effort is being currently undertaken by the HarmonicSS consortium in order to harmonise and integrate the largest European cohorts of pSS patients. In this review, we present an overview of our perception and vision, as well as new issues arising from this project such as harmonisation protocols and procedures, data sharing principles and various ethical and legal issues originating from these approaches. {\textcopyright} COPYRIGHT CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RHEUMATOLOGY 2019.},

abstract = {Skin cancer represents one of the most lethal and prevalent types of cancer observed in the human population. When diagnosed in its early stages, melanoma, a form of skin cancer, can be effectively treated and cured. Machine learning algorithms play a crucial role in facilitating the timely detection of skin cancer and aiding in the accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment of patients. However, the implementation of traditional machine learning approaches for skin disease diagnosis is impeded by privacy regulations, which necessitate centralized processing of patient data in cloud environments. To overcome the challenges associated with data privacy, federated learning emerges as a promising solution, enabling the development of privacy-aware healthcare systems for skin cancer diagnosis. This paper presents a comprehensive review that examines the obstacles faced by conventional machine learning algorithms and explores the integration of federated learning in the context of privacy-conscious skin cancer prediction healthcare systems. It provides discussion on the various datasets available for skin cancer prediction and provides a performance comparison of various machine learning and federated learning techniques for skin lesion prediction. The objective is to highlight the advantages offered by federated learning and its potential for addressing privacy concerns in the realm of skin cancer diagnosis. {\textcopyright} 2023 by the authors.},

abstract = {Measuring students' engagement in a distributed learning environment is a challenge. In particular, a teacher gives a lecture at one location, while at the same time the remote students watch the lecture through a display screen. In such situation, it is difficult for the teacher to know the reaction at the remote location. In this paper, we conducted a field study to measure students' engagement by using galvanic skin response (GSR) sensors, where students simultaneously watched the lecture at the two locations. Our results showed the students' GSR response was aligned with the surveys, which means that during a distributed learning environment, GSR sensors can be used as an indicator on students' engagement. Furthermore, our user studies resulted in non-engaging student learning experiences that would be difficult obtained at a lab condition. Based on the findings, we found that the patterns of GSR readings were rather different when compared to the previous relevant studies, where users were engaged. In addition, we noticed that the density of GSR response at the remote location was higher when compared to the one at the lecture room. We believe that our studies are beneficial on physiological computing, as we first presented the patterns of GSR sensors on non-engaging user experiences. Moreover, as an alternative method, GSR sensors can be easily implemented in a distributed learning environment to provide feedback to teachers.},

abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has been introduced to the healthcare domain as a decentralized learning paradigm that allows multiple parties to train a model collaboratively without privacy leakage. However, most previous studies have assumed that every client holds an identical label set. In reality, medical specialists tend to annotate only diseases within their area of expertise or interest. This implies that label sets in each client can be different and even disjoint. In this paper, we propose the framework FedLSM to solve the problem of Label Set Mismatch. FedLSM adopts different training strategies on data with different uncertainty levels to efficiently utilize unlabeled or partially labeled data as well as class-wise adaptive aggregation in the classification layer to avoid inaccurate aggregation when clients have missing labels. We evaluated FedLSM on two public real-world medical image datasets, including chest X-ray (CXR) diagnosis with 112,120 CXR images and skin lesion diagnosis with 10,015 dermoscopy images, and showed that it significantly outperformed other state-of-the-art FL algorithms.

abstract = {Nowadays, deep learning methods with large-scale datasets can produce clinically useful models for computer-aided diagnosis. However, the privacy and ethical concerns are increasingly critical, which make it difficult to collect large quantities of data from multiple institutions. Federated Learning (FL) provides a promising decentralized solution to train model collaboratively by exchanging client models instead of private data. However, the server aggregation of existing FL methods is observed to degrade the model performance in real-world medical FL setting, which is termed as retrogress. To address this problem, we propose a personalized retrogress-resilient framework to produce a superior personalized model for each client. Specifically, we devise a Progressive Fourier Aggregation (PFA) at the server to achieve more stable and effective global knowledge gathering by integrating client models from low-frequency to high-frequency gradually. Moreover, with an introduced deputy model to receive the aggregated server model, we design a Deputy-Enhanced Transfer (DET) strategy at the client and conduct three steps of Recover-Exchange-Sublimate to ameliorate the personalized local model by transferring the global knowledge smoothly. Extensive experiments on real-world dermoscopic FL dataset prove that our personalized retrogress-resilient framework outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods, as well as the generalization on an out-of-distribution cohort.

abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple institutes to train models collaboratively without sharing private data. Most of the current FL research focuses on perspectives such as communication efficiency, privacy protection, and personalization. Almost all work assumed that the data of FL are already ideally collected. However, in medical image analysis scenarios, data annotation demands both expertise and tedious labor, which means it is a critical problem that cannot be neglected in FL. In this study, we proposed a federated active learning (FedAL) framework that can decrease the annotation workload while maintaining the performance of FL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first federated active learning framework working on medical images. Using only up to 50% of samples, our FedAL was able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the real-world dermoscopic task. Our FedAL outperformed active learning methods under FL and achieved the performance comparable to full data FL.  {\textcopyright} 2022 IEEE.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine whether a brief Internet-based education programme could improve physicians' abilities to manage pigmented skin lesions. A pre-test-post-test assessment was used of subjects' knowledge of skin cancer, confidence in their management abilities and actual ability to recommend appropriate treatment for 20 hypothetical patients with pigmented skin lesions. The setting was the general medicine service of an academic medical centre. Seventeen volunteer medical students, house officers and faculty members took part in the study. Following the pre-test, subjects completed a 1-hour computer-based educational programme, distributed via the Internet, presenting a guideline for recognizing and managing potentially malignant pigmented skin lesions. The guideline was based on the ABCD rule and the Glasgow seven-point checklist. The educational programme had a positive effect on the subjects' overall skin cancer knowledge and had significantly positive effects on their confidence and ability to apply the management guideline. Based on the guideline criteria, the subjects made the correct management decision on the clinical scenarios 63.2% of the time before the programme and 74.1% of the time after the programme (P = 0.002). We were able to teach melanoma management guidelines to physicians and medical students using a brief, interactive computer programme distributed via the Internet. Such an approach is more cost-effective than classroom teaching and could be used to improve the clinical skills of practising physicians to recognize and manage early melanomas. This approach to distributed learning could also be used to teach other clinical guidelines to physicians.},

abstract = {Due to recent privacy trends and the increase in data breaches in various industries, it has become imperative to adopt new technologies that support data privacy, maintain accuracy, and ensure sustainability at the same time. The healthcare industry is one of the most vulnerable sectors to cyberattacks and data breaches as health data are highly sensitive and distributed in nature. The use of IoT devices with machine learning models to monitor the health status has made the challenge more acute, as it increases the distribution of health data and adds a decentralized structure to healthcare systems. A new privacy-preserving technology, namely, federated learning (FL), is promising for such a challenge as implementing solutions that integrate FL with deep learning, for healthcare applications that rely on IoT, provides several benefits by mainly preserving data privacy, building robust and high accuracy models, and dealing with the decentralized structure, thus achieving sustainability. This article proposes a deep FL (DFL) framework for healthcare data monitoring and analysis using IoT devices. Moreover, it proposes an FL algorithm that addresses the local training data acquisition process. Furthermore, it presents an experiment to detect skin diseases using the proposed framework. The extensive results collected show that the DFL models can preserve data privacy without sharing it, maintain the decentralized structure of the system made by IoT devices, improve the area under the curve (AUC) of the model to reach 97%, and reduce the operational costs (OC) for service providers. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {In recent years, automatic skin lesion diagnosis methods based on artificial intelligence have achieved great success. However, the lack of labeled data, visual similarity between skin diseases, and restriction on private data sharing remain the major challenges in skin lesion diagnosis. In this article, first, we propose a federated contrastive learning framework to break down data silos and enhance the generalizability of diagnostic model to unseen data. Subsequently, by combining data features from different participated nodes, the proposed framework can improve the performance of contrastive training. To extract discriminative features during on-device training, we propose a contrastive learning based intelligent skin lesion diagnosis scheme in edge computing networks. Specifically, a contrastive learning based dual encoder network is designed to overcome training sample scarcity by fully leveraging unlabeled samples for performance improvement. Meanwhile, we devise a maximum mean discrepancy based supervised contrastive loss function, which can efficiently explore complex intra-class and inter-class variances of samples. Finally, the diagnosis simulations demonstrate that compared with existing methods, our proposed scheme can achieve superior accuracy in both on-device training and distributed training scenarios.  {\textcopyright} 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Emotion recognition from physiological signals has seen a huge growth in recent decades. Wearables such as smart watches now have sensors to accurately measure physiological signals such as electrocardiography (ECG), blood volume pressure (BVP), galvanic skin response (GSR), and skin temperature (ST). These sensors have also been embedded in textiles. Collaborative body sensor networks (CBSN) have been used to analyse emotion reactions in a social setting from heart rate sensors. Federated learning, a recently proposed machine learning paradigm, protects user's private information while using information from several users to train a global machine learning model. Federated learning has several categorisations based on data partitioning, the privacy mechanisms, machine learning models and methods for solving heterogeneity. In this doctoral thesis, we propose using a smart clothing body sensor network to collect peripheral physiological data while protecting the user's privacy using federated machine learning. We present three primary research questions to address the challenges in emotion prediction, data collection from e-textile sensors and federated (FL) learning. {\textcopyright} 2022 ACM.},

abstract = {In this work, the federated learning mechanism is introduced into the deep learning of medical models in Internet of Things (IoT)-based healthcare system. Cryptographic primitives, including masks and homomorphic encryption, are applied for further protecting local models, so as to prevent the adversary from inferring private medical data by various attacks such as model reconstruction attack or model inversion attack, etc. The qualities of the datasets owned by different participants are considered as the main factor for measuring the contribution rate of the local model to the global model in each training epoch, instead of the size of datasets commonly used in deep learning. A dropout-tolerable scheme is proposed in which the process of federated learning would not be terminated if the number of online clients is not less than a preset threshold. Through the analysis of the security, it shows that the proposed scheme satisfies data privacy. Computation cost and communication cost are also analyzed theoretically. Finally, skin lesion classification using training images provided by the HAM10000 medical dataset is set as an example of healthcare applications.

abstract = {Monkeypox (Mpox) is a contagious viral illness that affects both humans and animals, and its early diagnosis is critical for the effective management and prevention of this disease. This work proposes a federated learning-Assisted self-supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) for Mpox identification from skin lesion images. The demand for domain experts for ground truth annotations is reduced with the help of self-supervised learning, as it can process unlabeled data. The self-supervision is driven by a framework called simple contrastive learning for representations (SimCLR), which extracts discriminative patterns of Mpox from the skin lesion images. Federated learning (FL), on the other hand, enables a privacy-preserved collaborative training approach to build the Mpox classifier on vast diverse datasets from several healthcare institutions, remotely. Thorough experimental study on a publicly available benchmark dataset, the proposed approach achieves competitive performances. {\textcopyright} 2023 IEEE.},

abstract = {Deployment of Deep Neural Networks in medical imaging is hindered by distribution shift between training data and data processed after deployment, causing performance degradation. Post-Deployment Adaptation (PDA) addresses this by tailoring a pre-trained, deployed model to the target data distribution using limited labelled or entirely unlabelled target data, while assuming no access to source training data as they cannot be deployed with the model due to privacy concerns and their large size. This makes reliable adaptation challenging due to limited learning signal. This paper challenges this assumption and introduces FedPDA, a novel adaptation framework that brings the utility of learning from remote data from Federated Learning into PDA. FedPDA enables a deployed model to obtain information from source data via remote gradient exchange, while aiming to optimize the model specifically for the target domain. Tailored for FedPDA, we introduce a novel optimization method StarAlign (Source-Target Remote Gradient Alignment) that aligns gradients between source-target domain pairs by maximizing their inner product, to facilitate learning a target-specific model. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness using multi-center databases for the tasks of cancer metastases detection and skin lesion classification, where our method compares favourably to previous work.

abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is an active area of research. One of the most suitable areas for adopting FL is the medical domain, where patient privacy must be respected. Previous research, however, does not provide a practical guide to applying FL in the medical domain. We propose empirical benchmarks and experimental settings for three representative medical datasets with different modalities: longitudinal electronic health records, skin cancer images, and electrocardiogram signals. The likely users of FL such as medical institutions and IT companies can take these benchmarks as guides for adopting FL and minimize their trial and error. For each dataset, each client data is from a different source to preserve real-world heterogeneity. We evaluate six FL algorithms designed for addressing data heterogeneity among clients, and a hybrid algorithm combining the strengths of two representative FL algorithms. Based on experiment results from three modalities, we discover that simple FL algorithms tend to outperform more sophisticated ones, while the hybrid algorithm consistently shows good, if not the best performance. We also find that a frequent global model update leads to better performance under a fixed training iteration budget. As the number of participating clients increases, higher cost is incurred due to increased IT administrators and GPUs, but the performance consistently increases. We expect future users will refer to these empirical benchmarks to design the FL experiments in the medical domain considering their clinical tasks and obtain stronger performance with lower costs. {\textcopyright} 2023 H.

abstract = {Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease that has various appearances and severity depending on the patient, and it requires continuous observation of the disease during several months of treatment. It is difficult to track changes in psoriasis severity using a patient's personal device owing to data security issues. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and federated learning (FL) approaches for data security have shown remarkable performance in vision tasks on medical images. However, in a client environment, disease images acquired from personal devices are unconstrained, and data loss can occur because of various environmental and physical noises. We used masking modeling to overcome data deformation and damage. In addition, we propose a masked attention model to improve the severity classification performance by extracting discriminative severity features from the masked image. As a result, when the masking ratio was set to 0.5, the severity classification of the FL-based masked attention model yielded the best classification performance, with an F1-score of 0.88. Psoriasis severity classification using the proposed method ensured data security and was robustly performed even during data deformation and damage. {\textcopyright} 2022 IEEE.},

abstract = {Recent trends in the healthcare industry, such as the use of wearable IoT for continuous health monitoring, are setting new requirements for healthcare systems that boost data analysis. These systems should support decentralization and maintain the privacy and ownership of users' data due to the sensitivity of healthcare data. Therefore, the use of federated learning techniques is recommended for systems that need such requirements. This paper proposes a Deep Federated Learning framework for decentralized healthcare systems that maintain user privacy in a distributed architecture. It also proposes an algorithm for an automated training data acquiring process. Furthermore, it presents an experiment for using deep federated learning in detecting skin diseases and using Transfer Learning to address the problem of limited availability of healthcare data in building deep learning models. The evaluated results show how the federated learning increased the Area Under the Curve of the centralized learning model up to 0.97, as it also shows good model performance during federated rounds in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Moreover, although the FL system has affected the quality of service to the user in terms of model conversion time, the Federated Learning system meets the requirements of building models in a decentralized manner with no sharing of users' private data. {\textcopyright} 2021 IEEE},

abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has recently been applied to skin lesion analysis, but the challenges of huge communication requirements and non-independent and identical distributions have not been fully addressed. The former problem arises from model parameter transfer between the server and clients, and the latter problem is due to differences in imaging protocols and operational customs. To reduce communication costs, dataset distillation methods have been adopted to distill thousands of real images into a few synthetic images (1 image per class) in each local client, which are then used to train a global model in the server. However, these methods often overlook the possible inter-client distribution drifts, limiting the performance of the global model. In this paper, we propose a generalizable dataset distillation-based federated learning (GDD-FL) framework to achieve communication-efficient federated skin lesion classification. Our framework includes the generalization dataset distillation (GDD) method, which explicitly models image features of the dataset into an uncertain Gaussian distribution and learns to produce synthetic images with features close to this distribution. The uncertainty in the mean and variance of the distribution enables the synthetic images to obtain diverse semantics and mitigate distribution drifts. Based on the GDD method, we further develop a communication-efficient FL framework that only needs to transmit a few synthesized images once for training a global model. We evaluate our approach on a large skin lesion classification dataset and compare it with existing dataset distillation methods and several powerful baselines. Our results show that our model consistently outperforms them, particularly in comparison to the classical FL method.

abstract = {In the medical field, federated learning commonly deals with highly imbalanced datasets, including skin lesions and gastrointestinal images. Existing federated methods under highly imbalanced datasets primarily focus on optimizing a global model without incorporating the intra-class variations that can arise in medical imaging due to different populations, findings, and scanners. In this paper, we study the inter-client intra-class variations with publicly available self-supervised auxiliary networks. Specifically, we find that employing a shared auxiliary pre-trained model, like MoCo-V2, locally on every client yields consistent divergence measurements. Based on these findings, we derive a dynamic balanced model aggregation via self-supervised priors (MAS) to guide the global model optimization. Fed-MAS can be utilized with different local learning methods for effective model aggregation toward a highly robust and unbiased global model.

abstract = {A major roadblock in machine learning for healthcare is the inability of data to be shared broadly, due to privacy concerns. Privacy preserving synthetic data generation is increasingly being seen as a solution to this problem. However, since healthcare data often has significant site-specific biases, it has motivated the use of federated learning when the goal is to utilize data from multiple sites for machine learning model training. Here, we introduce FELICIA (FEderated LearnIng with a CentralIzed Adversary), a generative mechanism enabling collaborative learning. It is a generalized extension of the (local) PrivGAN mechanism allowing to take into account the diversity (non-IID) nature of the federated sites. In particular, we show how a site with limited and biased data could benefit from other sites while keeping data from all the sources private. FELICIA works for a large family of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) architectures including vanilla and conditional GANs as demonstrated in this work. We show that by using the FELICIA mechanism, a site with a limited amount of images can generate high-quality synthetic images with improved utility, while none of the sites need to provide access to their real data. The sharing happens solely through a central discriminator with access limited to synthetic data. We demonstrate these benefits on several realistic healthcare scenarios using benchmark image datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10) as well as on medical images for the task of skin lesion classification. We show that the utility of synthetic images generated by FELICIA surpasses that of the data available locally and we demonstrate that it can correct the reduced utility of a biased subgroup within a class. {\textcopyright} 2021 ACM.},

Conventional procedures usually centralise data from various data sources to a single location and execute the analysis tasks on central servers. However, centralisation of medical data does not often comply with local data protection regulations due to its sensitive nature and the loss of sovereignty if data providers allow unlimited access to the data. The Personal Health Train (PHT) is a Distributed Analytics (DA) infrastructure bringing the algorithms to the data instead of vice versa. By following this paradigm shift, it proposes a solution for persistent privacyrelated challenges. In this work, we present a feasibility study, which demonstrates the capability of the PHT to perform statistical analyses and Machine Learning on skin lesion data distributed among three Germany-wide data providers. {\textcopyright} 2021 European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) and IOS Press. {\textcopyright} 2021 European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) and IOS Press.

abstract = {This work presents a novel method for securing federated learning in healthcare applications, focusing on skin cancer classification. The suggested solution detects and mitigates data poisoning attacks using deep learning and CNN architecture, specifically VGG16. In a federated learning architecture with ten healthcare institutions, the approach ensures collaborative model training while protecting sensitive medical data. Data is meticulously prepared and preprocessed using the Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000 dataset. The federated learning approach uses VGG16's powerful feature extraction to classify skin cancer. A robust strategy for spotting data poisoning threats in federated learning is presented in the study. Outlier detection techniques and strict criteria flag and evaluate problematic model modifications. Performance evaluation proves the model's accuracy, privacy, and data poisoning resilience. This research presents federated learning-based skin cancer categorization for healthcare applications that is secure and accurate. The suggested approach improves healthcare diagnostics and emphasizes data security and privacy in federated learning settings by tackling data poisoning attacks. {\textcopyright} 2023 Iraqi Journal for Computer Science and Mathematics.},

abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning method that offers medical institutes the prospect of collaboration in a global model while preserving the privacy of their patients. Although most medical centers conduct similar medical imaging tasks, their differences, such as specializations, number of patients, and devices, lead to distinctive data distributions. Data heterogeneity poses a challenge for FL and the personalization of the local models. In this work, we investigate an adaptive hierarchical clustering method for FL to produce intermediate semi-global models, so clients with similar data distribution have the chance of forming a more specialized model. Our method forms several clusters consisting of clients with the most similar data distributions; then, each cluster continues to train separately. Inside the cluster, we use meta-learning to improve the personalization of the participants' models. We compare the clustering approach with classical FedAvg and centralized training by evaluating our proposed methods on the HAM10k dataset for skin lesion classification with extreme heterogeneous data distribution. Our experiments demonstrate significant performance gain in heterogeneous distribution compared to standard FL methods in classification accuracy. Moreover, we show that the models converge faster if applied in clusters and outperform centralized training while using only a small subset of data. {\textcopyright} 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract = {With the most recent developments in wearable technology, the possibility of continually monitoring stress using various physiological factors has attracted much attention. By reducing the detrimental effects of chronic stress, early diagnosis of stress can enhance healthcare. Machine Learning (ML) models are trained for healthcare systems to track health status using adequate user data. Insufficient data is accessible, however, due to privacy concerns, making it challenging to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in the medical industry. This research aims to preserve the privacy of patient data while classifying wearable-based electrodermal activities. We propose a Federated Learning (FL) based approach using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. For experimentation, we use the Wearable Stress and Affect Detection (WESAD) dataset, which includes five data states: transient, baseline, stress, amusement, and meditation. We transform this raw dataset into a suitable form for the proposed methodology using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and min-max normalization pre-processing methods. In the FL-based technique, the DNN algorithm is trained on the dataset individually after receiving model updates from two clients. To decrease the over-fitting effect, every client analyses the results three times. Accuracies, Precision, Recall, F1-scores, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUROC) values are evaluated for each client. The experimental result shows the effectiveness of the federated learning-based technique on a DNN, reaching 86.82% accuracy while also providing privacy to the patient's data. Using the FL-based DNN model over a WESAD dataset improves the detection accuracy compared to the previous studies while also providing the privacy of patient data. {\textcopyright} 2023 by the authors.},

abstract = {Despite recent progress on semi-supervised federated learning (FL) for medical image diagnosis, the problem of imbalanced class distributions among unlabeled clients is still unsolved for real-world use. In this paper, we study a practical yet challenging problem of class imbalanced semi-supervised FL (imFed-Semi), which allows all clients to have only unlabeled data while the server just has a small amount of labeled data. This imFed-Semi problem is addressed by a novel dynamic bank learning scheme, which improves client training by exploiting class proportion information. This scheme consists of two parts, i.e., the dynamic bank construction to distill various class proportions for each local client, and the sub-bank classification to impose the local model to learn different class proportions. We evaluate our approach on two public real-world medical datasets, including the intracranial hemorrhage diagnosis with 25,000 CT slices and skin lesion diagnosis with 10,015 dermoscopy images. The effectiveness of our method has been validated with significant performance improvements (7.61% and 4.69%) compared with the second-best on the accuracy, as well as comprehensive analytical studies.

abstract = {Fairness is essential for trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare. However, the existing AI model may be biased in its decision marking. The bias induced by data itself, such as collecting data in subgroups only, can be mitigated by including more diversified data. Distributed and collaborative learning is an approach to involve training models in massive, heterogeneous, and distributed data sources, also known as nodes. In this work, we target on examining the fairness issue in Swarm Learning (SL), a recent edge-computing based decentralized machine learning approach, which is designed for heterogeneous illnesses detection in precision medicine. SL has achieved high performance in clinical applications, but no attempt has been made to evaluate if SL can improve fairness. To address the problem, we present an empirical study by comparing the fairness among single (node) training, SL, centralized training. Specifically, we evaluate on large public available skin lesion dataset, which contains samples from various subgroups. The experiments demonstrate that SL does not exacerbate the fairness problem compared to centralized training and improves both performance and fairness compared to single training. However, there still exists biases in SL model and the implementation of SL is more complex than the alternative two strategies. {\textcopyright} 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract = {Healthcare is one of the foremost applications of machine learning (ML). Traditionally, ML models are trained by central servers, which aggregate data from various distributed devices to forecast the results for newly generated data. This is a major concern as models can access sensitive user information, which raises privacy concerns. A federated learning (FL) approach can help address this issue: A global model sends its copy to all clients who train these copies, and the clients send the updates (weights) back to it. Over time, the global model improves and becomes more accurate. Data privacy is protected during training, as it is conducted locally on the clients' devices.However, the global model is susceptible to data poisoning. We develop a privacy-preserving FL technique for a skin cancer dataset and show that the model is prone to data poisoning attacks. Ten clients train the model, but one of them intentionally introduces flipped labels as an attack. This reduces the accuracy of the global model. As the percentage of label flipping increases, there is a noticeable decrease in accuracy. We use a stochastic gradient descent optimization algorithm to find the most optimal accuracy for the model. Although FL can protect user privacy for healthcare diagnostics, it is also vulnerable to data poisoning, which must be addressed. {\textcopyright} 2023 IEEE.},

abstract = {Nowadays, artificial intelligence promotes the rapid development of skin cancer detection technology, and the federated skin cancer detection model (FSDM) and dual generative adversarial network model (DGANM) solves the fragmentation and privacy of data to a certain extent. To overcome the problem that the many-objective evolutionary algorithm (MaOEA) cannot guarantee the convergence and diversity of the population when solving the above models, a many-objective evolutionary algorithm based on integrated strategy (MaOEA-IS) is proposed. First, the idea of federated learning is introduced into population mutation, the new parents are generated through sub-populations employs different mating selection operators. Then, the distance between each solution to the ideal point (SID) and the Achievement Scalarizing Function (ASF) value of each solution are considered comprehensively for environment selection, meanwhile, the elimination mechanism is used to carry out the select offspring operation. Eventually, the FSDM and DGANM are solved through MaOEA-IS. The experimental results show that the MaOEA-IS has better convergence and diversity, and it has superior performance in solving the FSDM and DGANM. The proposed MaOEA-IS provides more reasonable solutions scheme for many scholars of skin cancer detection and promotes the progress of intelligent medicine. {\textcopyright} 2022 Korean Society for Internet Information.

Parallel implementations of these algorithms are naturally expressed using the Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) model of computation. However, implementations using BSP are plagued by the straggler problem, where every transient slowdown of any given thread can delay all other threads. This paper presents the Stale Synchronous Parallel (SSP) model as a generalization of BSP that preserves many of its advantages, while avoiding the straggler problem. Algorithms using SSP can execute efficiently, even with significant delays in some threads, addressing the oft-faced straggler problem.},

abstract = {Objective: Deep learning has become a promising approach for automated support for clinical diagnosis. When medical data samples are limited, collaboration among multiple institutions is necessary to achieve high algorithm performance. However, sharing patient data often has limitations due to technical, legal, or ethical concerns. In this study,we propose methods of distributing deep learningmodels as an attractive alternative to sharing patient data. Methods: We simulate the distribution of deep learning models across 4 institutions using various training heuristics and compare the results with a deep learning model trained on centrally hosted patient data. The training heuristics investigated include ensembling single institution models, single weight transfer, and cyclical weight transfer. We evaluated these approaches for image classification in 3 independent image collections (retinal fundus photos, mammography, and ImageNet). Results: We find that cyclical weight transfer resulted in a performance that was comparable to that of centrally hosted patient data. We also found that there is an improvement in the performance of cyclical weight transfer heuristic with a high frequency of weight transfer. Conclusions: We show that distributing deep learning models is an effective alternative to sharing patient data. This finding has implications for any collaborative deep learning study.},

abstract = {Clinical diagnosis and therapy of brain tumors are greatly aided by proper classification of the tumors. Brain tumors can be diagnosed more quickly and accurately if radiologists use deep learning to help the specialist and doctors examine the enormous volume of brain MRI Images. Large datasets are required in training process, and whole of such data must be centralized for be handled by such techniques. It is sometimes impossible to collect and distribute patient data on a centralized data server because of medical data privacy regulations. In this paper, federated learning (FL) is proposed, in which data is non-shareable because of patient privacy issues. Using the FL approach, we have proposed two methods of aggregation; first, which concerns ranking the weight percentage of each client, and Second average weights method. and to evaluate the suggested model, we have compared the performance of the ranking weights percentage method with the average weights of proposed CNN and pre-training (VGG-16) in the FL environment in addition to SVM and VGG-16 . The experiments result was applied on two datasets, it shows our model accuracy result is very effective when using the ranking weight percentage method as compared with other methods, it achieves accuracy (98%) on datasets (BT_large-1c) and achieve (97.14%) on the dataset (BT-large-2c).},

abstract = {As data privacy becomes increasingly important, federated learning applied to the training of deep learning models while ensuring the data privacy of devices is entering the spotlight. Federated learning makes it possible to process all data at once while processing data independently from various devices without collecting distributed local data in a central server. However, there are still challenges to overcome for the system of devices in federated learning such as communication overheads and the heterogeneity of the system. In this paper, we propose the Adjusting Mini-Batch and Local Epoch (AMBLE) approach, which adaptively adjusts the local mini-batch and local epoch size for heterogeneous devices in federated learning and updates the parameters synchronously. With AMBLE, we enhance the computational efficiency by removing stragglers and scaling the local learning rate to improve the model convergence rate and accuracy. We verify that federated learning with AMBLE is a stably trained model with a faster convergence speed and higher accuracy than FedAvg and adaptive batch size scheme for both identically and independently distributed (IID) and non-IID cases.},

Machine learning has witnessed a tremendous amount of attention over the last few years. The current boom started around 2009 when so-called deep artificial neural networks began outperforming other established models on a number of important benchmarks. Deep neural networks are now the state-of-the-art machine learning models across a variety of areas, from image analysis to natural language processing, and widely deployed in academia and industry. These developments have a huge potential for medical imaging technology, medical data analysis, medical diagnostics and healthcare in general, slowly being realized. We provide a short overview of recent advances and some associated challenges in machine learning applied to medical image processing and image analysis. As this has become a very broad and fast expanding field we will not survey the entire landscape of applications, but put particular focus on deep learning in MRI. Our aim is threefold: (i)give a brief introduction to deep learning with pointers to core references; (ii)indicate how deep learning has been applied to the entire MRI processing chain, from acquisition to image retrieval, from segmentation to disease prediction; (iii)provide a starting point for people interested in experimenting and perhaps contributing to the field of deep learning for medical imaging by pointing out good educational resources, state-of-the-art open-source code, and interesting sources of data and problems related medical imaging.},

abstract = {Modern mobile devices have access to a wealth of data suitable for learning models, which in turn can greatly improve the user experience on the device. For example, language models can improve speech recognition and text entry, and image models can automatically select good photos. However, this rich data is often privacy sensitive, large in quantity, or both, which may preclude logging to the data center and training there using conventional approaches. We advocate an alternative that leaves the training data distributed on the mobile devices, and learns a shared model by aggregating locally-computed updates. We term this decentralized approach Federated Learning. We present a practical method for the federated learning of deep networks based on iterative model averaging, and conduct an extensive empirical evaluation, considering five different model architectures and four datasets. These experiments demonstrate the approach is robust to the unbalanced and non-IID data distributions that are a defining characteristic of this setting. Communication costs are the principal constraint, and we show a reduction in required communication rounds by 10–100x as compared to synchronized stochastic gradient descent.},

abstract = {The emerging Federated Learning (FL) enables IoT devices to collaboratively learn a shared model based on their local datasets. However, due to end devices' heterogeneity, it will magnify the inherent synchronization barrier issue of FL and result in non-negligible waiting time when local models are trained with the identical batch size. Moreover, the useless waiting time will further lead to a great strain on devices' limited battery life. Herein, we aim to alleviate the negative impact of synchronization barrier through adaptive batch size during model training. When using different batch sizes, stability and convergence of the global model should be enforced by assigning appropriate learning rates on different devices. Therefore, we first study the relationship between batch size and learning rate, and formulate a scaling rule to guide the setting of learning rate in terms of batch size. Then we theoretically analyze the convergence rate of global model and obtain a convergence upper bound. On these bases, we propose an efficient algorithm that adaptively adjusts batch size with scaled learning rate for heterogeneous devices to reduce the waiting time and save battery life. We conduct extensive simulations and testbed experiments, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

Misdiagnosis of brain tumor type will both prevent the patient from responding effectively to the applied treatment and decrease the patient's chances of survival. In this study, we propose a solution for classifying brain tumors in MR images using transfer learning networks. The most common brain tumors are detected with VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50 and DenseNet21 networks using transfer learning. Deep transfer learning networks are trained and tested using four different optimization algorithms (Adadelta, ADAM, RMSprop and SGD) on the accessible Figshare dataset containing 3064 T1-weighted MR images from 233 patients with three common brain tumor types: glioma (1426 images), meningioma (708 images) and pituitary (930 images). The area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy metrics were used as performance measures. The proposed transfer learning methods have a level of success that can be compared with studies in the literature; the highest classification performance is 99.02% with ResNet50 using Adadelta. The classification result proved that the most common brain tumors can be classified with very high performance. Thus, the transfer learning model is promising in medicine and can help doctors make quick and accurate decisions.},

However, building an appropriate DL model is a challenging task, due to the dynamic nature and variations in real-world problems and data. Moreover, the lack of core understanding turns DL methods into black-box machines that hamper development at the standard level. This article presents a structured and comprehensive view on DL techniques including a taxonomy considering various types of real-world tasks like supervised or unsupervised. In our taxonomy, we take into account deep networks for supervised or discriminative learning, unsupervised or generative learning as well as hybrid learning and relevant others. We also summarize real-world application areas where deep learning techniques can be used. Finally, we point out ten potential aspects for future generation DL modeling with research directions. Overall, this article aims to draw a big picture on DL modeling that can be used as a reference guide for both academia and industry professionals.},

abstract = {Volatility plays a significant role in pricing derivatives, managing portfolio risk, and using hedging strategies in the financial markets. As a result, it is imperative to precisely estimate the volatility of key natural resources, including crude oil, gold, copper, natural gas, and silver. The likelihood of some countries' budget deficits exceeding permissible levels increased due to recent uncertainties brought on by geo-political threats. This article employs a hybrid model of LSTM-GJR-GARCH (1,1) with hyperparameter tuning to forecast the volatility of the prices of significant natural resources using daily closing prices for crude oil, natural gas, silver, copper, and gold from January 2012 to July 2022. Our results demonstrate that, compared to utilising standard LSTM-GJR-GARCH, employing hyperparameter adjustment increases volatility predictions by an average of 40%–70%. We also looked at the connection between the geo-political risk index and the overall connectedness of natural resources. Our findings suggest that geo-political risk uncertainty does not account for the overall interconnectedness of natural resources' prices. Because they may better understand future volatility and manage their portfolios and budgets by estimating the price volatility of natural resources, our findings are important for politicians, governments, and investors.},

Recognizing its grade is challenging for radiologists in health monitoring and automated determination; however, IoT can help. It is critical to detect and classify contaminated tumor locations using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images. Numerous tumors exist, including glioma tumor, meningioma tumor, pituitary tumor, and no tumor (benign). Detecting the type of tumor and preventing it is one of the most challenging aspects of brain tumor categorization. Numerous deep learning-based approaches for categorizing brain tumors have been published in the literature. A CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), the most advanced method in deep learning, was used to detect a tumor using brain MRI images. However, there are still issues with the training procedure, which is lengthy. The main goal of this project is to develop an IoT computational system based on deep learning for detecting brain tumors in MRI images. This paper suggests combining A CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) with an STM(Long Short Term Memory), LSTMs can supplement the ability of CNN to extract features. When used for image classification, the layered LSTM-CNN design outperforms standard CNN classification. Experiments are undertaken to forecast the proposed model's performance using the Kaggle data set, which contains 3264 MRI scans. The dataset is separated into two sections: 2870 photos of training sets and 394 images of testing sets. The experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms earlier CNN and RNN models in terms of accuracy.},

Data parallelism is one of the widely-used distributed training schemes, and various algorithms for the data parallelism have been studied. However, since most of studies assumed homogeneous computing environment, there is a problem that they do not consider a heterogeneous performance graphics processing unit (GPU) cluster environment. The heterogeneous performance environment leads to differences in computation time between GPU workers in the synchronous data parallelism. Due to the difference of the computation time of one iteration, the straggler problem that fast workers wait for the slowest worker makes training speed slow. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a batch-orchestration algorithm (BOA), reducing the training time by improving hardware efficiency in the heterogeneous performance GPU cluster. The proposed algorithm coordinates local mini-batch sizes for all workers to reduce the training iteration time. We confirmed that the proposed algorithm improves the performance by 23% over the synchronous SGD with one back-up worker when training ResNet-194 using 8 GPUs of three different types.},

As an obvious result, the training and inference is time consuming. For example, a classic Resnet50 classification model will be trained in 14 days on a NVIDIA M40 GPU with ImageNet data set. Thus, distributed acceleration is a very useful way to dispatch the computation of training and even inference to scale of nodes in parallel and accelerate the whole process. Facebook's work and UC Berkeley's acceleration can training the Resnet-50 model within hour and minutes by distributed deep learning algorithm and system, representatively. As other distributed accelerations, it gives a possibility to accelerate large models on large data sets from weeks to minutes, which gives researchers and developers more space to explore and search. However, besides acceleration, what other issues will be confronted of the distributed deep learning system? Where is the upper limit of acceleration? What application will acceleration be used for?

abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is an emerging privacy-preserving paradigm that enables multiple participants collaboratively to train a global model without uploading raw data. Considering heterogeneous computing and communication capabilities of different participants, asynchronous FL can avoid the stragglers effect in synchronous FL and adapts to scenarios with vast participants. Both staleness and non-IID data in asynchronous FL would reduce the model utility. However, there exists an inherent contradiction between the solutions to the two problems. That is, mitigating the staleness requires to select less but consistent gradients while coping with non-IID data demands more comprehensive gradients. To address the dilemma, this paper proposes a two-stage weighted K asynchronous FL with adaptive learning rate (WKAFL). By selecting consistent gradients and adjusting learning rate adaptively, WKAFL utilizes stale gradients and mitigates the impact of non-IID data, which can achieve multifaceted enhancement in training speed, prediction accuracy and training stability. We also present the convergence analysis for WKAFL under the assumption of unbounded staleness to understand the impact of staleness and non-IID data. Experiments implemented on both benchmark and synthetic FL datasets show that WKAFL has better overall performance compared to existing algorithms.},

abstract = {The computational requirements for training deep neural networks (DNNs) have grown to the point that it is now standard practice to parallelize training. Existing deep learning systems commonly use data or model parallelism, but unfortunately, these strategies often result in suboptimal parallelization performance. In this paper, we define a more comprehensive search space of parallelization strategies for DNNs called SOAP, which includes strategies to parallelize a DNN in the Sample, Operation, Attribute, and Parameter dimensions. We also propose FlexFlow, a deep learning framework that uses guided randomized search of the SOAP space to find a fast parallelization strategy for a specific parallel machine. To accelerate this search, FlexFlow introduces a novel execution simulator that can accurately predict a parallelization strategy's performance and is three orders of magnitude faster than prior approaches that have to execute each strategy. We evaluate FlexFlow with six real-world DNN benchmarks on two GPU clusters and show that FlexFlow can increase training throughput by up to 3.8x over state-of-the-art approaches, even when including its search time, and also improves scalability.},

In trendy days, artificial intelligence algorithms are rising as a brand new computing technique which will be applied to actual time issues. In modern days, neural network algorithms are emerging as a new artificial intelligence technique that can be applied to real-time problems. The proposed system is to detect a classification of botnet attack which poses a serious threat to financial sectors and banking services. The proposed system is created by applying artificial intelligence on a realistic cyber defense dataset (CSE-CIC-IDS2018), the very latest Intrusion Detection Dataset created in 2018 by Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC) on AWS (Amazon Web Services). The proposed system of Artificial Neural Networks provides an outstanding performance of Accuracy score is 99.97% and an average area under ROC (Receiver Operator Characteristic) curve is 0.999 and an average False Positive rate is a mere value of 0.001. The proposed system using artificial intelligence of botnet attack detection is powerful, more accurate and precise.

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

@article{Liu2023,
abstract = {Deep learning (DL) has become a key component of modern software. In the "big model"era, the rich features of DL-based software (i.e., DL software) substantially rely on powerful DL models, e.g., BERT, GPT-3, and the recently emerging GPT-4, which are trained on the powerful cloud with large datasets. Hence, training effective DL models has become a vital stage in the whole software lifecycle. When training deep learning models, especially those big models, developers need to parallelize and distribute the computation and memory resources amongst multiple devices (e.g., a cluster of GPUs) in the training process, which is known as distributed deep learning training, or distributed training for short. However, the unique challenges that developers encounter in distributed training process have not been studied in the software engineering community. Given the increasingly heavy dependence of current DL-based software on distributed training, this paper aims to fill in the knowledge gap and presents the first comprehensive study on developers' issues in distributed training. To this end, we focus on popular DL frameworks that support distributed training (including TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and Horovod) and analyze 1,131 real-world developers' issues about using these frameworks reported on Stack Overflow and GitHub. We construct a fine-grained taxonomy consisting of 30 categories regarding the fault symptoms and summarize common fix patterns for different symptoms. We find that: (1) many distributed-specific faults and non-distributed-specific faults inherently share the same fault symptoms, making it challenging to debug; (2) most of the fault symptoms have frequent fix patterns; (3) about half of the faults are related to system-level configurations. Based on the results, we suggest actionable implications on research avenues that can potentially facilitate the distributed training to develop DL-based software, such as focusing on the frequent and common fix patterns when designing testing or debugging tools, developing efficient testing and debugging techniques for communication configuration along with the synthesis of network configuration analysis, designing new multi-device checkpoint-and-replay techniques to help reproduction, and designing serverless APIs for cloud platforms.},

abstract = {The 'Roaring 20s' of visual recognition began with the introduction of Vision Transformers (ViTs), which quickly superseded ConvNets as the state-of-the-art image classification model. A vanilla ViT, on the other hand, faces difficulties when applied to general computer vision tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. It is the hierarchical Transformers (e.g., Swin Transformers) that reintroduced several ConvNet priors, making Transformers practically viable as a generic vision backbone and demonstrating remarkable performance on a wide variety of vision tasks. However, the effectiveness of such hybrid approaches is still largely credited to the intrinsic superiority of Transformers, rather than the inherent inductive biases of convolutions. In this work, we reexamine the design spaces and test the limits of what a pure ConvNet can achieve. We gradually 'modernize' a standard ResNet toward the design of a vision Transformer, and discover several key components that contribute to the performance difference along the way. The outcome of this exploration is a family of pure ConvNet models dubbed ConvNeXt. Constructed entirely from standard ConvNet modules, ConvNeXts compete favorably with Transformers in terms of accuracy and scalability, achieving 87.8% ImageNet top-1 accuracy and outperforming Swin Transformers on COCO detection and ADE20K segmentation, while maintaining the simplicity and efficiency of standard ConvNets.},

abstract = {The selection of the hyper-parameters plays a critical role in the task of prediction based on the recurrent neural networks (RNN). Traditionally, the hyper-parameters of the machine learning models are selected by simulations as well as human experiences. In recent years, multiple algorithms based on Bayesian optimization (BO) are developed to determine the optimal values of the hyperparameters. In most of these methods, gradients are required to be calculated. In this work, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used under the BO framework to develop a new method for hyper-parameter optimization. The proposed algorithm (BO-PSO) is free of gradient calculation and the particles can be optimized in parallel naturally. So the computational complexity can be effectively reduced which means better hyper-parameters can be obtained under the same amount of calculation. Experiments are done on real world power load data, where the proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art algorithms, BO with limit-BFGS-bound (BO-L-BFGS-B) and BO with truncated-newton (BO-TNC), in terms of the prediction accuracy. The errors of the prediction result in different models show that BO-PSO is an effective hyper-parameter optimization method.},

Currently, researchers are devising artificial intelligence based tools to improve the diagnostic capabilities. The machine learning (ML) requires hand-crafted features to train the algorithms.

We fed these features to traditional ML algorithms such as k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM). The SVM yielded an accuracy of 83.0%, whereas KNN produced an accuracy of 97.0%. We then optimized and employed the ensemble extreme boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, which improved the detection performance with precision, recall, and accuracy of 100%. We also optimized and employed the deep learning ResNet101 to distinguish the small cell cancer from non-small cell lung cancer and obtained the 100% performance with these evaluation performance measures. The results revealed that proposed approach is more robust than traditional ML algorithms.

In this paper, we consider the problem of training a deep network with billions of parameters using tens of thousands of CPU cores. We have developed a software framework called DistBelief that can utilize computing clusters with thousands of machines to train large models. Within this framework, we have developed two algorithms for large-scale distributed training: (i) Downpour SGD, an asynchronous stochastic gradient descent procedure supporting a large number of model replicas, and (ii) Sandblaster, a framework that supports a variety of distributed batch optimization procedures, including a distributed implementation of L-BFGS. Downpour SGD and Sandblaster L-BFGS both increase the scale and speed of deep network training. We have successfully used our system to train a deep network 30x larger than previously reported in the literature, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet, a visual object recognition task with 16 million images and 21k categories.

abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm where a shared central model is learned across distributed devices while the training data remains on these devices. Federated Averaging (FedAvg) is the leading optimization method for training non-convex models in this setting with a synchronized protocol. However, the assumptions made by FedAvg are not realistic given the heterogeneity of devices. First, the volume and distribution of collected data vary in the training process due to different sampling rates of edge devices. Second, the edge devices themselves also vary in latency and system configurations, such as memory, processor speed, and power requirements. This leads to vastly different computation times. Third, availability issues at edge devices can lead to a lack of contribution from specific edge devices to the federated model. In this paper, we present an Asynchronous Online Federated Learning (ASO-Fed) framework, where the edge devices perform online learning with continuous streaming local data and a central server aggregates model parameters from clients. Our framework updates the central model in an asynchronous manner to tackle the challenges associated with both varying computational loads at heterogeneous edge devices and edge devices that lag behind or dropout. We perform extensive experiments on a benchmark image dataset and three real-world datasets with non-IID streaming data. The results demonstrate ASO-Fed converging fast and maintaining good prediction performance.},

abstract = {The potential for deep learning to improve medical image analysis is often stymied by the difficulty in acquiring and collecting sufficient data to train models. One major barrier to data acquisition is the private and sensitive nature of the data in question, as concerns about patient privacy, among others, make data sharing between institutions difficult. Distributed learning avoids the need to share data centrally by training models locally. One approach to distributed learning is federated learning, where models are trained in parallel at local institutions and aggregated together into a global model. The 2021 Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) challenge focuses on federated learning for brain tumor segmentation using magnetic resonance imaging scans collected from a real-world federation of collaborating institutions. We developed a federated training algorithm that uses a combination of variable local epochs in each federated round, a decaying learning rate, and an ensemble weight aggregation function. When testing on unseen validation data our model trained with federated learning achieves very similar performance (average DSC score of 0.674) to a central model trained on pooled data (average DSC score 0.685). When our federated learning algorithm was evaluated on unseen training and testing data, it achieved similar performances on the FeTS challenge leaderboards 1 and 2 (average DSC scores of 0.623 and 0.608, respectively). This federated learning algorithm offers an approach to training deep learning learning models without the need to share private and sensitive patient data.},

FL embodies the principles of focused data collection and minimization, and can mitigate many of the systemic privacy risks and costs resulting from traditional, centralized machine learning and data science approaches.

abstract = {We introduce a new and increasingly relevant setting for distributed optimization in machine learning, where the data defining the optimization are unevenly distributed over an extremely large number of nodes. The goal is to train a high-quality centralized model. We refer to this setting as Federated Optimization. In this setting, communication efficiency is of the utmost importance and minimizing the number of rounds of communication is the principal goal. A motivating example arises when we keep the training data locally on users' mobile devices instead of logging it to a data center for training. In federated optimziation, the devices are used as compute nodes performing computation on their local data in order to update a global model. We suppose that we have extremely large number of devices in the network --- as many as the number of users of a given service, each of which has only a tiny fraction of the total data available. In particular, we expect the number of data points available locally to be much smaller than the number of devices. Additionally, since different users generate data with different patterns, it is reasonable to assume that no device has a representative sample of the overall distribution. We show that existing algorithms are not suitable for this setting, and propose a new algorithm which shows encouraging experimental results for sparse convex problems. This work also sets a path for future research needed in the context of \federated optimization.},

abstract = {The broad application of artificial intelligence techniques in medicine is currently hindered by limited dataset availability for algorithm training and validation, due to the absence of standardized electronic medical records, and strict legal and ethical requirements to protect patient privacy. In medical imaging, harmonized data exchange formats such as Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine and electronic data storage are the standard, partially addressing the first issue, but the requirements for privacy preservation are equally strict. To prevent patient privacy compromise while promoting scientific research on large datasets that aims to improve patient care, the implementation of technical solutions to simultaneously address the demands for data protection and utilization is mandatory. Here we present an overview of current and next-generation methods for federated, secure and privacy-preserving artificial intelligence with a focus on medical imaging applications, alongside potential attack vectors and future prospects in medical imaging and beyond.},

@article{Remedios2020,
abstract = {Purpose: As deep neural networks achieve more success in the wide field of computer vision, greater emphasis is being placed on the generalizations of these models for production deployment. With sufficiently large training datasets, models can typically avoid overfitting their data; however, for medical imaging it is often difficult to obtain enough data from a single site. Sharing data between institutions is also frequently nonviable or prohibited due to security measures and research compliance constraints, enforced to guard protected health information (PHI) and patient anonymity. Methods: In this paper, we implement cyclic weight transfer with independent datasets from multiple geographically disparate sites without compromising PHI. We compare results between single-site learning (SSL) and multisite learning (MSL) models on testing data drawn from each of the training sites as well as two other institutions. Results: The MSL model attains an average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.690 on the holdout institution datasets with a volume correlation of 0.914, respectively corresponding to a 7% and 5% statistically significant improvement over the average of both SSL models, which attained an average DSC of 0.646 and average correlation of 0.871. Conclusions: We show that a neural network can be efficiently trained on data from two physically remote sites without consolidating patient data to a single location. The resulting network improves model generalization and achieves higher average DSCs on external datasets than neural networks trained on data from a single source.},

abstract = {Medical institutions often revoke data access due to the privacy concern of patients. Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative learning paradigm that can generate an unbiased global model based on collecting updates from local models trained by client's data while keeping the local data private. This study aims to address the centralized data collection issue through the application of FL on brain tumor identification from MRI images. At first, several CNN models were trained using the MRI data and the best three performing CNN models were selected to form different variants of ensemble classifiers. Afterward, the FL model was constructed using the ensemble architecture. It was trained using model weights from the local model without sharing the client's data (MRI images) using the FL approach. Experimental results show only a slight decline in the performance of the FL approach as it achieved 91.05% accuracy compared to the 96.68% accuracy of the base ensemble model. Additionally, same approach was taken for another slightly larger dataset to prove the scalability of the method. This study shows that the FL approach can achieve privacy-protected tumor classification from MRI images without compromising much accuracy compared to the traditional deep learning approach.},

abstract = {Federated learning is an approach to distributed machine learning where a global model is learned by aggregating models that have been trained locally on data-generating clients. Contrary to centralized optimization, clients can be very large in number and face challenges of data and network heterogeneity. Examples of clients include smartphones and connected vehicles, which highlights the practical relevance of federated learning. We benchmark three federated learning algorithms and compare their performance against a centralized approach where data resides on the server. The algorithms Federated Averaging (FedAvg), Federated Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient, and CO-OP are evaluated on the MNIST dataset, using both i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. partitionings of the data. Our results show that FedAvg achieves the highest accuracy among the federated algorithms, regardless of how data was partitioned. Our comparison between FedAvg and centralized learning shows that they are practically equivalent when i.i.d. data is used. However, the centralized approach outperforms FedAvg with non-i.i.d. data.},

@article{Luo2023,
abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the correlation between differences in data distributions and federated deep learning (Fed-DL) algorithm performance in tumor segmentation on CT and MR images. Materials and Methods: Two Fed-DL datasets were retrospectively collected (from November 2020 to December 2021): one dataset of liver tumor CT images (Federated Imaging in Liver Tumor Segmentation [or, FILTS]; three sites, 692 scans) and one publicly avail-able dataset of brain tumor MR images (Federated Tumor Segmentation [or, FeTS]; 23 sites, 1251 scans). Scans from both datasets were grouped according to site, tumor type, tumor size, dataset size, and tumor intensity. To quantify differences in data distributions, the following four distance metrics were calculated: earth mover's distance (EMD), Bhattacharyya distance (BD), $\chi$2 distance (CSD), and Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance (KSD). Both federated and centralized nnU-Net models were trained by using the same grouped datasets. Fed-DL model performance was evaluated by using the ratio of Dice coefficients, $\theta$, between federated and centralized models trained and tested on the same 80:20 split datasets. Results: The Dice coefficient ratio ($\theta$) between federated and centralized models was strongly negatively correlated with the distances between data distributions, with correlation coefficients of −0.920 for EMD, −0.893 for BD, and −0.899 for CSD. However, KSD was weakly correlated with $\theta$, with a correlation coefficient of −0.479. Conclusion: Performance of Fed-DL models in tumor segmentation on CT and MRI datasets was strongly negatively correlated with the distances between data distributions. {\textcopyright} RSNA, 2023.},

@article{Haggenmuller2024,
abstract = {Importance: The development of artificial intelligence (AI)-based melanoma classifiers typically calls for large, centralized datasets, requiring hospitals to give away their patient data, which raises serious privacy concerns. To address this concern, decentralized federated learning has been proposed, where classifier development is distributed across hospitals. Objective: To investigate whether a more privacy-preserving federated learning approach can achieve comparable diagnostic performance to a classical centralized (ie, single-model) and ensemble learning approach for AI-based melanoma diagnostics. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicentric, single-arm diagnostic study developed a federated model for melanoma-nevus classification using histopathological whole-slide images prospectively acquired at 6 German university hospitals between April 2021 and February 2023 and benchmarked it using both a holdout and an external test dataset. Data analysis was performed from February to April 2023. Exposures: All whole-slide images were retrospectively analyzed by an AI-based classifier without influencing routine clinical care. Main Outcomes and Measures: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) served as the primary end point for evaluating the diagnostic performance. Secondary end points included balanced accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Results: The study included 1025 whole-slide images of clinically melanoma-suspicious skin lesions from 923 patients, consisting of 388 histopathologically confirmed invasive melanomas and 637 nevi. The median (range) age at diagnosis was 58 (18-95) years for the training set, 57 (18-93) years for the holdout test dataset, and 61 (18-95) years for the external test dataset; the median (range) Breslow thickness was 0.70 (0.10-34.00) mm, 0.70 (0.20-14.40) mm, and 0.80 (0.30-20.00) mm, respectively. The federated approach (0.8579; 95% CI, 0.7693-0.9299) performed significantly worse than the classical centralized approach (0.9024; 95% CI, 0.8379-0.9565) in terms of AUROC on a holdout test dataset (pairwise Wilcoxon signed-rank, P <.001) but performed significantly better (0.9126; 95% CI, 0.8810-0.9412) than the classical centralized approach (0.9045; 95% CI, 0.8701-0.9331) on an external test dataset (pairwise Wilcoxon signed-rank, P <.001). Notably, the federated approach performed significantly worse than the ensemble approach on both the holdout (0.8867; 95% CI, 0.8103-0.9481) and external test dataset (0.9227; 95% CI, 0.8941-0.9479). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this diagnostic study suggest that federated learning is a viable approach for the binary classification of invasive melanomas and nevi on a clinically representative distributed dataset. Federated learning can improve privacy protection in AI-based melanoma diagnostics while simultaneously promoting collaboration across institutions and countries. Moreover, it may have the potential to be extended to other image classification tasks in digital cancer histopathology and beyond. {\textcopyright} 2024 American Medical Association.

abstract = {Skin cancer is a prevalent type of cancer that affects millions of people globally. However, detecting it can be a challenging task, even for specialized dermatologists. Early detection is crucial for successful treatment, and deep learning techniques, particularly deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), have shown tremendous potential in this area. However, achieving high accuracy results requires large volumes of data for training these DCNNs. Since medical organizations and institutions, individually, do not usually have such amounts of information available, and due to the current regulations regarding intellectual property and privacy of medical patient data, it is difficult to share data in a direct way. The primary objective of this work is to overcome this issue through a federated learning approach. We created a privacy-preserving and accurate skin cancer classification system that can assist dermatologists and specialists in making informed patient care decisions. The federated learning DCNNs architecture uses a combination of convolutional and pooling layers to extract relevant features from skin lesion images. It also includes a fully connected layer for classification. To evaluate the proposed architecture, we tested it on three datasets of varying complexity and size. The results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed solution and its efficiency for skin cancer classification. {\textcopyright} 2024 The Author(s).

abstract = {The performance of deep networks for medical image analysis is often constrained by limited medical data, which is privacy-sensitive. Federated learning (FL) alleviates the constraint by allowing different institutions to collaboratively train a federated model without sharing data. However, the federated model is often suboptimal with respect to the characteristics of each client's local data. Instead of training a single global model, we propose Customized FL (CusFL), for which each client iteratively trains a client-specific/private model based on a federated global model aggregated from all private models trained in the immediate previous iteration. Two overarching strategies employed by CusFL lead to its superior performance: 1) the federated model is mainly for feature alignment and thus only consists of feature extraction layers; 2) the federated feature extractor is used to guide the training of each private model. In that way, CusFL allows each client to selectively learn useful knowledge from the federated model to improve its personalized model. We evaluated CusFL on multi-source medical image datasets for the identification of clinically significant prostate cancer and the classification of skin lesions. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Human skin disease, the most infectious dermatological ailment globally, is initially diagnosed by sight. Some clinical screening and dermoscopic analysis of skin biopsies and scrapings for accurate classification are medically compulsory. Classification of skin diseases using medical images is more challenging because of the complex formation and variant colors of the disease and data security concerns. Both the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for classification and a federated learning approach for data privacy preservation show significant performance in the realm of medical imaging fields. In this paper, a custom image dataset was prepared with four classes of skin disease, a CNN model was suggested and compared with several benchmark CNN algorithms, and an experiment was carried out to ensure data privacy using a federated learning approach. An image augmentation strategy was followed to enlarge the dataset and make the model more general. The proposed model achieved a precision of 86%, 43%, and 60%, and a recall of 67%, 60%, and 60% for acne, eczema, and psoriasis. In the federated learning approach, after distributing the dataset among 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500 clients, the model showed an average accuracy of 81.21%, 86.57%, 91.15%, and 94.15%. The CNN-based skin disease classification merged with the federated learning approach is a breathtaking concept to classify human skin diseases while ensuring data security. {\textcopyright} 2022 IEEE.},

abstract = {The accurate and timely diagnosis of skin cancer is crucial as it can be a life-threatening disease. However, the implementation of traditional machine learning algorithms in healthcare settings is faced with significant challenges due to data privacy concerns. To tackle this issue, we propose a privacy-aware machine learning approach for skin cancer detection that utilizes asynchronous federated learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our method optimizes communication rounds by dividing the CNN layers into shallow and deep layers, with the shallow layers being updated more frequently. In order to enhance the accuracy and convergence of the central model, we introduce a temporally weighted aggregation approach that takes advantage of previously trained local models. Our approach is evaluated on a skin cancer dataset, and the results show that it outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and communication cost. Specifically, our approach achieves a higher accuracy rate while requiring fewer communication rounds. The results suggest that our proposed method can be a promising solution for improving skin cancer diagnosis while also addressing data privacy concerns in healthcare settings. {\textcopyright} 2023 by the authors.},

abstract = {Skin cancer is one of the most deadly cancers worldwide. Yet, it can be reduced by early detection. Recent deep-learning methods have shown a dermatologist-level performance in skin cancer classification. Yet, this success demands a large amount of centralized data, which is oftentimes not available. Federated learning has been recently introduced to train machine learning models in a privacy-preserved distributed fashion demanding annotated data at the clients, which is usually expensive and not available, especially in the medical field. To this end, we propose FedPerl, a semi-supervised federated learning method that utilizes peer learning from social sciences and ensemble averaging from committee machines to build communities and encourage its members to learn from each other such that they produce more accurate pseudo labels. We also propose the peer anonymization (PA) technique as a core component of FedPerl. PA preserves privacy and reduces the communication cost while maintaining the performance without additional complexity. We validated our method on 38,000 skin lesion images collected from 4 publicly available datasets. FedPerl achieves superior performance over the baselines and state-of-the-art SSFL by 15.8%, and 1.8% respectively. Further, FedPerl shows less sensitivity to noisy clients (https://github.com/tbdair/FedPerlV1.0 ). {\textcopyright} 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The accuracy of the DNN is largely governed by the quality and quantity of the data used to train the model. However, for the medical images, the critical security and privacy concerns regarding sharing of local medical data across medical establishments precludes exploiting the full DNN potential for clinical diagnosis. The federated learning (FL) approach enables the use of local model's parameters to train a global model, while ensuring data privacy and security. In this paper, we review the federated learning applications in medical image analysis with DNNs, highlight the security concerns, cover some efforts to improve FL model performance, and describe the challenges and future research directions. {\textcopyright} 2023 by the authors.},

@article{WangGong2023,
abstract = {Background: The proliferation of mobile health (mHealth) applications is partly driven by the advancements in sensing and communication technologies, as well as the integration of artificial intelligence techniques. Data collected from mHealth applications, for example, on sensor devices carried by patients, can be mined and analyzed using artificial intelligence–based solutions to facilitate remote and (near) real-time decision-making in health care settings. However, such data often sit in data silos, and patients are often concerned about the privacy implications of sharing their raw data. Federated learning (FL) is a potential solution, as it allows multiple data owners to collaboratively train a machine learning model without requiring access to each other's raw data. Objective: The goal of this scoping review is to gain an understanding of FL and its potential in dealing with sensitive and heterogeneous data in mHealth applications. Through this review, various stakeholders, such as health care providers, practitioners, and policy makers, can gain insight into the limitations and challenges associated with using FL in mHealth and make informed decisions when considering implementing FL-based solutions. Methods: We conducted a scoping review following the guidelines of PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews). We searched 7 commonly used databases. The included studies were analyzed and summarized to identify the possible real-world applications and associated challenges of using FL in mHealth settings. Results: A total of 1095 articles were retrieved during the database search, and 26 articles that met the inclusion criteria were included in the review. The analysis of these articles revealed 2 main application areas for FL in mHealth, that is, remote monitoring and diagnostic and treatment support. More specifically, FL was found to be commonly used for monitoring self-care ability, health status, and disease progression, as well as in diagnosis and treatment support of diseases. The review also identified several challenges (eg, expensive communication, statistical heterogeneity, and system heterogeneity) and potential solutions (eg, compression schemes, model personalization, and active sampling). Conclusions: This scoping review has highlighted the potential of FL as a privacy-preserving approach in mHealth applications and identified the technical limitations associated with its use. The challenges and opportunities outlined in this review can inform the research agenda for future studies in this field, to overcome these limitations and further advance the use of FL in mHealth. {\textcopyright} Tongnian Wang, Yan Du, Yanmin Gong, Kim-Kwang Raymond Choo, Yuanxiong Guo.},

abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising technique in the field of medical diagnosis. By distributing the same task through deep networks on mobile devices, FL has proven effective in diagnosing dermatitis, a common and easily recognizable skin disease. However, in skin disease diagnosis, FL poses challenges related to (1) prioritizing generalization over personalization and (2) limited utilization of mobile devices. Despite its improved comprehensive diagnostic performance, skin disease diagnosis should aim for personalized diagnosis rather than centralized and generalized diagnosis, due to personal diversities and variability, such as skin color, wrinkles, and aging. To this end, we propose a novel deep learning network for personalized diagnosis in an adaptive manner, utilizing personal characteristics in diagnosing dermatitis in a mobile- and FL-based environment. Our framework, dubbed APD-Net, achieves adaptive and personalized diagnosis using a new model design and a genetic algorithm (GA)-based fine-tuning method. APD-Net incorporates a novel architectural design that leverages personalized and centralized parameters, along with a fine-tuning method based on a modified GA to identify personal characteristics. We validated APD-Net on clinical datasets and demonstrated its superior performance, compared with state-of-the-art approaches. Our experimental results showed that APD-Net markedly improved personalized diagnostic accuracy by 9.9% in dermatitis diagnosis, making it a promising tool for clinical practice. {\textcopyright} The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.},

abstract = {This work proposes a new metaheuristic called Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) inspired by grey wolves (Canis lupus). The GWO algorithm mimics the leadership hierarchy and hunting mechanism of grey wolves in nature. Four types of grey wolves such as alpha, beta, delta, and omega are employed for simulating the leadership hierarchy. In addition, the three main steps of hunting, searching for prey, encircling prey, and attacking prey, are implemented. The algorithm is then benchmarked on 29 well-known test functions, and the results are verified by a comparative study with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA), Differential Evolution (DE), Evolutionary Programming (EP), and Evolution Strategy (ES). The results show that the GWO algorithm is able to provide very competitive results compared to these well-known metaheuristics. The paper also considers solving three classical engineering design problems (tension/compression spring, welded beam, and pressure vessel designs) and presents a real application of the proposed method in the field of optical engineering. The results of the classical engineering design problems and real application prove that the proposed algorithm is applicable to challenging problems with unknown search spaces. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is one of recent metaheuristics swarm intelligence methods. It has been widely tailored for a wide variety of optimization problems due to its impressive characteristics over other swarm intelligence methods: it has very few parameters, and no derivation information is required in the initial search. Also it is simple, easy to use, flexible, scalable, and has a special capability to strike the right balance between the exploration and exploitation during the search which leads to favourable convergence. Therefore, the GWO has recently gained a very big research interest with tremendous audiences from several domains in a very short time. Thus, in this review paper, several research publications using GWO have been overviewed and summarized. Initially, an introductory information about GWO is provided which illustrates the natural foundation context and its related optimization conceptual framework. The main operations of GWO are procedurally discussed, and the theoretical foundation is described. Furthermore, the recent versions of GWO are discussed in detail which are categorized into modified, hybridized and paralleled versions. The main applications of GWO are also thoroughly described. The applications belong to the domains of global optimization, power engineering, bioinformatics, environmental applications, machine learning, networking and image processing, etc. The open source software of GWO is also provided. The review paper is ended by providing a summary conclusion of the main foundation of GWO and suggests several possible future directions that can be further investigated.},

abstract = {Skin cancer is considered a dangerous type of cancer with a high global mortality rate. Manual skin cancer diagnosis is a challenging and time-consuming method due to the complexity of the disease. Recently, deep learning and transfer learning have been the most effective methods for diagnosing this deadly cancer. To aid dermatologists and other healthcare professionals in classifying images into melanoma and nonmelanoma cancer and enabling the treatment of patients at an early stage, this systematic literature review (SLR) presents various federated learning (FL) and transfer learning (TL) techniques that have been widely applied. This study explores the FL and TL classifiers by evaluating them in terms of the performance metrics reported in research studies, which include true positive rate (TPR), true negative rate (TNR), area under the curve (AUC), and accuracy (ACC). This study was assembled and systemized by reviewing well-reputed studies published in eminent fora between January 2018 and July 2023. The existing literature was compiled through a systematic search of seven well-reputed databases. A total of 86 articles were included in this SLR. This SLR contains the most recent research on FL and TL algorithms for classifying malignant skin cancer. In addition, a taxonomy is presented that summarizes the many malignant and non-malignant cancer classes. The results of this SLR highlight the limitations and challenges of recent research. Consequently, the future direction of work and opportunities for interested researchers are established that help them in the automated classification of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers.},

abstract = {The medical industry regards the prevention and detection of skin diseases as a top priority. The number of people suffering from skin diseases is increasing faster than ever before due to increased levels of pollution and poor diet. Although it's not the major priority, having bad skin makes us less certain. Regularly inspecting your skin is an important step in identifying any degenerative or early changes in your skin that could lead to skin disease. Machine learning algorithms can be utilized to create robust models that can categorize a wide range of skin conditions. First, the skin and non-skin must be distinguished in order to identify skin conditions. In order to determine the unambiguous a group of skin conditions A selection of five distinct machine learning algorithms has been employed to compile a dataset of skin infections. These algorithms include Kernel Self- pattern, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and CNN, among others. A comparable investigation based on training accuracy and skepticism matrix criterion has been carried out and illustrated with graphs. It has been determined that, of all the applicants, CNN offers the highest level of training accuracy for the appropriate assumption of skin disorders. {\textcopyright} 2024 IEEE.},

abstract = {Cancer, including the highly dangerous melanoma, is marked by uncontrolled cell growth and the possibility of spreading to other parts of the body. However, the conventional approach to machine learning relies on centralized training data, posing challenges for data privacy in healthcare systems driven by artificial intelligence. The collection of data from diverse sensors leads to increased computing costs, while privacy restrictions make it challenging to employ traditional machine learning methods. Researchers are currently confronted with the formidable task of developing a skin cancer prediction technique that takes privacy concerns into account while simultaneously improving accuracy. In this work, we aimed to propose a decentralized privacy-aware learning mechanism to accurately predict melanoma skin cancer. In this research we analyzed federated learning from the skin cancer database. The results from the study showed that 92% accuracy was achieved by the proposed method, which was higher than baseline algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2023 by the authors.},

abstract = {Skin diseases present a complex challenge for mechanical analysis due to the inherent irregularities in skin texture, varying complexions, and the presence of hair and other surface features. The need for an accurate and automated system for skin disease detection is paramount. However, the task is compounded by issues such as dataset imbalance and stringent data privacy concerns associated with medical images. In this study, we harnessed the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in the domain of Medical Image Analysis (MIA) to classify skin diseases. Additionally, we employed a federated learning approach to safeguard data privacy. Our results demonstrate the remarkable performance of CNNs, achieving an accuracy score of 0.90 in skin disease classification. Building upon these findings, we propose the development of a mobile application tailored for skin disease classification, leveraging CNNs and the federated learning strategy. This mobile app offers an innovative solution for skin analysis while maintaining the highest data security and privacy standards. In conclusion, our research underscores the potential of CNNs and federated learning in the realm of skin disease classification. We introduce a promising path for the creation of an efficient mobile application for skin disease diagnosis, meeting the rigorous demands of modern medical data handling and analysis without compromising data security or privacy. {\textcopyright} 2023 IEEE.},

abstract = {Melanoma disease analysis is increasingly approached using statistical machine learning techniques, including deep learning. These techniques require large sizes of datasets. However, health institutions are inhibited from sharing their patients' data due to concerns regarding the privacy of subjects. This paper presents a methodology that utilizes Federated Learning (FL) in ensuring the preservation of subjects' privacy during training. We fused two modalities: skin lesion images and their corresponding clinical data. The performance of the global federated model was compared with the results of a Centralized Learning (CL) scenario. The FL model is on-par with the CL model with only 0.39% and 0.73% higher F1-Score and Accuracy performances, respectively, obtained by the CL model. Through extended fine-tuning, the performance difference could be further minimized. Moreover, the FL model was 3.27% more sensitive than the CL model, hence correctly classified more positives than the CL model. Our model also obtained competitive performance when compared with other models from literature. The results indicate the capability of federated learning in effectively learning high predictive models while ensuring no training data is shared among the participating clients. {\textcopyright} 2021 IEEE.},

The article then focuses on the analysis of skin lesion images, which are complex and difficult to classify. The article presents a unique CNN model (skin-net) using a progressively private federated learning architecture to potentially address these issues. Recent advancements in medical image analysis using convolutional neural networks and federated learning techniques have shown promising results (96.19 accuracy, 96.37 sensitivity and 96.53 specificity) in accurately classifying skin diseases while maintaining data privacy. Using these methods offers a potentially effective way to examine human skin while improving the model's generalization performance through image augmentation. {\textcopyright} 2023 IEEE.},

  abstract = 	 { Federated Averaging (FedAvg), also known as Local SGD, is one of the most popular algorithms in Federated Learning (FL). Despite its simplicity and popularity, the convergence rate of FedAvg has thus far been undetermined. Even under the simplest assumptions (convex, smooth, homogeneous, and bounded covariance), the best-known upper and lower bounds do not match, and it is not clear whether the existing analysis captures the capacity of the algorithm. In this work, we first resolve this question by providing a lower bound for FedAvg that matches the existing upper bound, which shows the existing FedAvg upper bound analysis is not improvable. Additionally, we establish a lower bound in a heterogeneous setting that nearly matches the existing upper bound. While our lower bounds show the limitations of FedAvg, under an additional assumption of third-order smoothness, we prove more optimistic state-of-the-art convergence results in both convex and non-convex settings. Our analysis stems from a notion we call iterate bias, which is defined by the deviation of the expectation of the SGD trajectory from the noiseless gradient descent trajectory with the same initialization. We prove novel sharp bounds on this quantity, and show intuitively how to analyze this quantity from a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) perspective. }

  abstract = 	 {Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) are commonly developed at a fixed resource budget, and then scaled up for better accuracy if more resources are given. In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on MobileNets and ResNet. To go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves stateof-the-art 84.4% top-1 / 97.1% top-5 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet (Huang et al., 2018). Our EfficientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7%), Flower (98.8%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.}
